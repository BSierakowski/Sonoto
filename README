Sonoto is a python script that monitors your Stack Overflow threads and notifies you on twitter when they're updated with additional comments or answers.

Todo:

Make one trip to API and DB in the beginning, use and modify lists from that point forward
Check to see if number of answers have changed
Tweet upon DB update!
